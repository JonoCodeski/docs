## Tutorial 1: Smart Word Selection

Not all words are worth learning immediately. Learn to prioritize effectively.

### Understanding Word Frequency

<Steps>
  <Step title="Recognize High-Frequency Words">
    **Focus on common words first:**
    - Words that appear multiple times in your reading
    - Basic vocabulary that appears across different topics
    - Words you encounter in multiple sources
    - Essential words for your learning goals
  </Step>

  <Step title="Identify Personal Priority Words">
    **Choose words relevant to you:**
    - Vocabulary related to your interests or profession
    - Words from topics you read about frequently
    - Terms that appear in your target communication scenarios
    - Words that unlock understanding of longer passages
  </Step>

  <Step title="Skip Low-Priority Words">
    **Don't learn everything:**
    - Extremely rare or technical terms (unless you need them)
    - Words you can easily guess from context
    - Proper nouns and place names
    - Words that appear only once in very specific contexts
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Strategic Word Selection Exercise

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="The 80/20 Rule">
    **Focus on high-impact vocabulary:**
    - 20% of words appear 80% of the time
    - Learn the most frequent 1,000-2,000 words first
    - These provide maximum comprehension improvement
    - Build foundation before adding specialized vocabulary
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Context-Based Selection">
    **Choose words that enhance comprehension:**
    - Words that help you understand paragraph themes
    - Connecting words that show relationships between ideas
    - Keywords that appear in headings and important sentences
    - Words that help you infer meaning of other unknown words
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Personal Relevance Filter">
    **Prioritize personally useful vocabulary:**
    - Words related to your hobbies and interests
    - Professional or academic terminology you need
    - Words for situations you'll encounter
    - Vocabulary that connects to your existing knowledge
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
**Practice Exercise**: Read an article and click 15-20 words. Now categorize them as "High Priority" (learn immediately), "Medium Priority" (learn later), or "Low Priority" (skip for now). Focus your energy on the high-priority words.
</Note>

## Tutorial 2: Effective Categorization System

Master MyLang Reader's categorization system for optimal learning.

### Understanding the Four Categories

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="New (Blue)">
    **First encounter with a word:**
    - Just clicked for the first time
    - Awaiting your categorization decision
    - Temporary state - should be processed regularly
    - **Action needed**: Decide where this word belongs
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Learning (Yellow)">
    **Active study vocabulary:**
    - Words you're currently working to master
    - Appear in flashcard practice sessions
    - Need repeated exposure and practice
    - **Goal**: Move to "Known" when mastered
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Known (Green)">
    **Mastered vocabulary:**
    - Words you recognize and understand well
    - Don't need active practice anymore
    - Help track your progress and achievement
    - **Result**: Excluded from practice by default
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Difficult (Red)">
    **Challenging vocabulary needing extra attention:**
    - Complex words with multiple meanings
    - Abstract concepts that are hard to remember
    - Words you've struggled with repeatedly
    - **Treatment**: Get extra repetition in practice
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Categorization Best Practices

<Steps>
  <Step title="Be Honest About Your Knowledge">
    **Accurate assessment is crucial:**
    - Don't mark words as "Known" just to feel good
    - Be realistic about partial understanding
    - Consider if you could use the word in conversation
    - Test yourself: can you recall the word without seeing it?
  </Step>

  <Step title="Regular Categorization Sessions">
    **Process new words frequently:**
    - Review "New" words weekly (don't let them accumulate)
    - Spend 5-10 minutes categorizing after reading sessions
    - Update categories as your knowledge changes
    - Move words between categories as you progress
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use the Difficult Category Strategically">
    **For words that need extra attention:**
    - Words you keep forgetting despite practice
    - Complex words with multiple meanings
    - Abstract concepts that don't stick easily
    - Words that confuse you with similar-looking words
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Category Management Workflow

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Daily Workflow">
    1. **During reading**: Click words naturally, don't stop to categorize
    2. **After reading**: Quick categorization of 5-10 most important words
    3. **End of session**: Mark obvious "Known" words to clean up interface
    4. **Weekly review**: Process accumulated "New" words thoughtfully
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Progressive Movement">
    - **New → Learning**: When you decide to actively study a word
    - **Learning → Known**: When you've truly mastered the word
    - **Learning → Difficult**: When a word proves challenging
    - **Difficult → Learning**: When you've made progress on difficult words
    - **Known → Learning**: If you realize you don't know a word as well as thought
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
