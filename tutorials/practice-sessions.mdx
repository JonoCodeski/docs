## Tutorial 1: Understanding Spaced Repetition

Learn the science behind effective vocabulary practice.

### The Forgetting Curve

<Steps>
  <Step title="Recognize Natural Forgetting">
    **Without review, you forget rapidly:**
    - 50% forgotten within 1 hour of learning
    - 70% forgotten within 24 hours
    - 90% forgotten within a week
    - This is normal human memory behavior
  </Step>

  <Step title="Understand Spaced Review Benefits">
    **Strategic timing prevents forgetting:**
    - Review just before you would forget
    - Each successful review extends memory
    - Intervals get longer with each success
    - Eventually moves to long-term memory
  </Step>

  <Step title="See the Algorithm in Action">
    **How MyLang Reader optimizes timing:**
    - New words: Short intervals (1 min, 10 min, 1 day)
    - Learning words: Graduated intervals based on performance
    - Review words: Long intervals (weeks to months)
    - Failed words: Return to short intervals
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Card Types and Progression

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="New Cards">
    **Introduction phase:**
    - First time seeing words in practice
    - Multiple short intervals in single session
    - Foundation building for memory formation
    - Limited daily quantity for optimal learning
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Learning Cards">
    **Active learning phase:**
    - Words in short-term memory formation
    - Intervals: 1 minute → 10 minutes → 1 day
    - Require multiple successful reviews to graduate
    - Most mentally demanding but crucial phase
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Review Cards">
    **Long-term maintenance:**
    - Words in long-term memory
    - Intervals: days → weeks → months
    - Maintain existing knowledge
    - Easier but essential for retention
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
**Key Insight**: The learning phase is where the real work happens. New cards introduce vocabulary, but learning cards build lasting memory. Don't rush through this phase.
</Note>

## Tutorial 2: Your First Practice Session

Experience the practice system hands-on.

### Starting a Practice Session

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Practice Dashboard">
    **Navigate to practice:**
    - Click "Practice" in main navigation
    - See your practice dashboard with due cards
    - Check new cards, learning cards, and reviews
    - Note estimated study time
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose Session Type">
    **Select based on your goals:**
    - **Mixed Session**: Balanced practice (recommended for most users)
    - **New Cards**: Learn completely new vocabulary
    - **Learning**: Focus on words in active learning phase
    - **Review**: Maintain previously learned vocabulary
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start Your Session">
    **Begin practice:**
    - Click "Start [Session Type]"
    - First card appears with target language word
    - Try to recall the meaning before revealing answer
    - This mental effort is crucial for memory formation
  </Step>
</Steps>

### The Practice Interface

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Card Presentation">
    **What you see:**
    - Target language word or phrase
    - Context sentence (when available)
    - Audio pronunciation button (Premium)
    - "Show Answer" button when you're ready
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Answer Revelation">
    **After clicking "Show Answer":**
    - Translation in your native language
    - Definition and usage notes
    - Context from where you encountered the word
    - Four self-assessment buttons
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Self-Assessment Options">
    **Rate your performance honestly:**
    - **Again (Red)**: Didn't know at all
    - **Hard (Orange)**: Knew but struggled or hesitated
    - **Good (Green)**: Knew correctly
    - **Easy (Blue)**: Knew instantly and effortlessly
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Your First 10 Cards

<Steps>
  <Step title="Focus on the Process">
    **For your first practice:**
    - Try to recall before revealing answer
    - Be honest with self-assessment
    - Don't worry about speed - accuracy matters more
    - Notice how different ratings affect scheduling
  </Step>

  <Step title="Practice Self-Assessment">
    **Learn to rate accurately:**
    - "Again" if you had no idea or guessed wrong
    - "Hard" if you hesitated or partially knew
    - "Good" if you knew it correctly without struggle
    - "Easy" if you knew instantly - use sparingly
  </Step>

  <Step title="Observe the Algorithm">
    **Notice adaptive behavior:**
    - Cards you mark "Again" return quickly
    - "Good" cards have longer intervals
    - "Easy" cards may graduate immediately
    - System adapts to your individual performance
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
**Practice Exercise**: Complete a 10-card practice session right now. Focus on honest self-assessment rather than speed. Notice how the algorithm responds to your ratings.
</Note>

## Tutorial 3: Optimizing Self-Assessment

Accurate self-assessment is crucial for algorithm effectiveness.

### Understanding Each Rating

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Again (Red) - Use When">
    **Complete failure to recall:**
    - Had no idea what the word meant
    - Guessed completely wrong
    - Confused it with a different word
    - **Effect**: Card returns in 1 minute for immediate reinforcement
    - **Don't be afraid**: Better to over-review than under-review
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Hard (Orange) - Use When">
    **Partial or hesitant knowledge:**
    - Knew the general meaning but not precisely
    - Hesitated for several seconds before recalling
    - Got it right but it felt difficult
    - **Effect**: Shorter interval than normal, extra practice
    - **Common rating**: Most learning happens in this zone
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Good (Green) - Use When">
    **Correct and confident recall:**
    - Knew the answer within 2-3 seconds
    - Felt confident about the meaning
    - No hesitation or guessing
    - **Effect**: Standard interval progression
    - **Most common**: Should be your default for known words
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Easy (Blue) - Use When">
    **Instant and effortless recall:**
    - Knew immediately without any thought
    - Word feels completely natural
    - Could use confidently in conversation
    - **Effect**: Extended interval, may graduate quickly
    - **Use sparingly**: Only for truly effortless words
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Common Self-Assessment Mistakes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Being Too Generous">
    **Problem**: Marking "Good" when you hesitated
    **Result**: Algorithm schedules reviews too far apart
    **Solution**: Be honest about hesitation - use "Hard" more often
    **Test**: If you paused to think, it's probably "Hard," not "Good"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Being Too Harsh">
    **Problem**: Marking "Again" for minor hesitation
    **Result**: Excessive repetition and slower progress
    **Solution**: "Hard" is for imperfect but partially correct responses
    **Remember**: Perfect recall isn't required for "Good" rating
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Overusing "Easy"">
    **Problem**: Marking familiar words as "Easy"
    **Result**: Words graduate before they're truly mastered
    **Solution**: Reserve "Easy" for absolutely effortless recall
    **Test**: Would you use this word confidently in conversation?
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Inconsistent Standards">
    **Problem**: Changing criteria between sessions
    **Result**: Algorithm receives mixed signals
    **Solution**: Establish consistent internal standards
    **Tip**: Focus on how confident you felt, not just correctness
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Self-Assessment Practice Exercise

<Steps>
  <Step title="Calibrate Your Standards">
    **Practice with known difficulty levels:**
    - Find a word you know very well → Should be "Good" or "Easy"
    - Find a word you're learning → Probably "Hard" when you recall it
    - Find a difficult word → Often "Again" when you encounter it
    - Use these as reference points
  </Step>

  <Step title="Focus on Feeling, Not Just Correctness">
    **Rate based on confidence:**
    - Did you feel certain or uncertain?
    - How long did it take to recall?
    - Would you trust this knowledge in conversation?
    - Physical hesitation often indicates "Hard"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Track Your Patterns">
    **Notice your tendencies:**
    - Do you tend to be too generous or too harsh?
    - Are you consistent between sessions?
    - How do your ratings correlate with actual retention?
    - Adjust based on long-term results
  </Step>
</Steps>
