## Overview

MyLang Reader uses scientifically-proven spaced repetition to help you retain vocabulary long-term. The practice system adapts to your performance and optimizes review timing for maximum retention with minimum effort.

## Understanding Spaced Repetition

### The Science Behind It

Spaced repetition leverages the psychological spacing effect:
- **Initial learning**: Rapid forgetting without review
- **Spaced reviews**: Strategic timing prevents forgetting
- **Increasing intervals**: Successful reviews space out further
- **Long-term retention**: Words move to long-term memory

## Effective Practice Strategies

### Daily Routine Optimization

<Steps>
  <Step title="Consistent Timing">
    Practice at the same time daily for habit formation
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start with Reviews">
    Clear overdue cards before learning new ones
  </Step>
  <Step title="Balanced Sessions">
    Mix new cards, learning, and reviews appropriately
  </Step>
  <Step title="Quality over Quantity">
    Focus on accurate self-assessment rather than speed
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Self-Assessment Guidelines

<Tips>
  <Tip>
    **Be honest with ratings** - accurate assessment improves the algorithm
  </Tip>
  <Tip>
    **Use "Again" liberally** - better to over-review than under-review
  </Tip>
  <Tip>
    **Consider context** - word difficulty may vary by usage
  </Tip>
  <Tip>
    **Rate immediately** - don't overthink the assessment
  </Tip>
</Tips>

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

<Warning>
**Overloading with new cards**: Too many new words overwhelms memory formation
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Inconsistent practice**: Irregular sessions reduce algorithm effectiveness
</Warning>

<Warning>
**Lenient self-assessment**: Being too generous with ratings leads to poor retention
</Warning>
